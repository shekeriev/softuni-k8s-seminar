# softuni-k8s-seminar
Supporting files for the seminar **First Steps with Kubernetes** held on 11.02.2021 at SoftUni.

Files are provided in the following structure:
* Demo-Files folder contains the sample configuration files
* Docker-Images folder and its sub-folders contain the files necessary to produce the referred container images. You may use your own images, but keep in mind that you should adjust the configuration files as well
* demo-script.txt file contains the commands used during the demo

For better experience load the *demo-script.txt* file in an editor with an integrated terminal (like Visual Studio Code, Kate, Atom, Sublime, etc.), highlight and execute commands one by one, and check the results.
